* Micro ROS Zephyr Modules

  This is a demo for Zephyr modularized [[https://micro.ros.org/][micro-ROS]], [[https://github.com/yashi/libros2-zephyr][libros2-zephyr]].  It
  is, obviously, targeting [[https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr][Zephyr RTOS]].

  This is still in pre-release preview only state.  It sort of builds
  but nothing works.

* How to build

    mkdir workspace
    cd workspace
